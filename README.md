# Facial_Recognization
Introduction
A real time face recognition system is capable of identifying or verifying a person from a video frame. The facial recognition has been emerged in multiple fields and sciences, especially in computer science, others  fields that are very interested In this technology are: Mechatronic, Robotic, criminalistics, etc. 
Background
Facial recognition is a computer application composes for complex algorithms that use mathematical  techniques, these get the image in digital format and then process and compare pixel by pixel using different methods for obtain a faster and reliable results.
Planning
This project is divided into two parts: creating a database, and training and testing.
Requirements:
•	Python 2.7 or Python 3+ 
•	Linux or  Windows
•	OpenCV
